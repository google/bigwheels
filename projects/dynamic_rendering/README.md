# Dynamic Rendering

This sample renders two spheres, one rotating around the other.
This sample is used to demonstrate use of dynamic render passes.
The first sphere is drawn in one command buffer with a suspending render pass, and the second sphere is drawn in a different command buffer with a resuming render pass.
